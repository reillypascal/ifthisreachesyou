Electric Piano Plugins:

Download "Sweetcase Vintage Electric Piano" from NoiseAsh Audio Tools (https://www.noiseash.com/sweetcase-vintage-electric-piano/), or another Rhodes-like VST. "Sweetcase" is free, but must be downloaded by each user to comply with licensing requirements. There are no restrictions on performance or sale of recordings made with this plugin. Only the plugin itself cannot be redistributed (see license included with plugin download for more information).

Install the VST instrument on your computer, and then locate the .dll (Win)/.vst (Mac) file to load into the patch. Sweetcase has 32-bit and 64-bit versions for Windows and VST and AU versions for Mac. Please note that Max does not support AU plugins, so use the VST version on Mac.

For "Sweetcase," set "bass boost" to 3 o'clock; "bell" to minimum; and when recording in stereo, turn up "intensity" just slightly. The default settings work fine, but I like these a bit better. The goal is to have a warm, full sound that retains clarity and (when projecting in stereo) has a touch of stereo panning modulation; keep this in mind if using another plugin.
